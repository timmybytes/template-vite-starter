## Test

This is a test post to verify that MDX files are being processed correctly in the Vite project setup. Below is a code snippet to demonstrate syntax highlighting:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
const TestComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return <div>Hello, MDX with Vite!</div>;
};
export default TestComponent;
```
