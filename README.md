# Template Vite Starter

This repo serves as a basic starter template, wired up with the following:

- Vite.js + TypeScript
- twin.macro for Tailwind CSS with Emotion
- Framer Motion for animations
- Plop for generating new components, hooks, and contexts
- husky and lint-staged for pre-commit linting and checks
- Some basic tooling and configurations
